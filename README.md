# minimicro-chip8
A CHIP-8 emulator for Mini Micro

This is a program to simulate the [CHIP-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8) virtual computer in [Mini Micro](https://miniscript.org/MiniMicro/).

It was developed on Feb 27, 2022 during a live-stream on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/joestrout/schedule).  I've spent only 1.5 hours on it so far, and it is still incomplete, though it does run the "tank" demo.

Next week I'll put some in some more time to finish it up.
